# 2025-10-31

- Archived old docs site to `archive/docs-site-20251031/`.
- Created clean `docs/` structure (journal, adr, architecture, assets).
- Wrote docs/README.md with conventions, added roadmap and changelog.
- Archived duplicate root app files to `archive/root-duplicates-20251031/` (use `src/` going forward).
- Removed `sync:docs` script from package.json.

Next ideas
- Decide on single Pages workflow (keep build â†’ dist; remove static repo deploy).
- Add ADRs for navigation and asset strategy.
