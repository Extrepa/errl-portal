# 2025-11-22 — Project Structure Refactoring

## Summary
Major refactoring of project structure, reorganizing the codebase into a clearer `src/apps/*` organization. This separates concerns into distinct applications: landing page, static pages, studio application, and shared resources.

## New Structure

### `src/apps/landing/`
Contains the main landing page portal experience:
- Landing page (`index.html`)
- FX effects system (`fx/`)
- Supporting scripts (`scripts/`)
- Styles (`styles/`)

### `src/apps/static/`
Contains static HTML pages:
- Legacy app entry (`app-legacy.js`)
- Portal pages (about, gallery, assets, events, merch, games, pin-designer, dev)
- Studio pages (math-lab, shape-madness, pin-widget, svg-colorer)
- CSS-only experiments

### `src/apps/studio/`
React-based studio application:
- Studio features (`features/live-studio/`)
- Studio app code (`src/app/`)
- Main entry points (`index.html`, `main.tsx`)

### `src/shared/`
Shared resources and utilities used across applications:
- Shared assets
- Common utilities
- Cross-app dependencies

## Configuration Updates
- `vite.config.ts` — Updated build configuration for new structure
- `vite.studio.config.ts` — Updated studio-specific build config
- `tsconfig.json` — Updated TypeScript paths and includes
- `tailwind.config.ts` — Updated content paths for new structure

## Files Moved
- Moved portal pages from `src/portal/pages/` to `src/apps/static/pages/`
- Moved landing page code to `src/apps/landing/`
- Moved React studio code to `src/apps/studio/`
- Moved shared assets and utilities to `src/shared/`

## Benefits
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Easier to navigate and understand project structure
- Better organization for future development
- Configurations updated to match new structure
