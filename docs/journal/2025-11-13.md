# 2025-11-13 — Component Normalization Wave 4

## Summary
Normalized 15 additional components from the raw component rips archive, bringing total normalized components from 25 to 40 (60% increase). Focused on standalone components and successfully extracted 2 Framer export cursors.

## Components Normalized

### Cursors (3)
- **Fluffy Pixel Trail**: Pixelated cursor trail with fluffy particle bursts. Adjustable spawn rate, decay, and pixel size.
- **Pixel Square Rainbow**: Pixelated square cursor trail with rainbow color cycling. Extracted from Framer export.
- **Weird Motion Trace**: Distorted motion trace cursor with sine/cosine distortion effects. Extracted from Framer export.

### Backgrounds (7)
- **Anisotropic Velvet**: Interactive velvet texture with anisotropic lighting. Drag pointer to comb the velvet.
- **Basic Shadow Bubbles**: Caustic sparkles under frosted glass. Interactive bubble particles.
- **Band W Squiggle**: Time-crystal particle trails with difference blending mode.
- **Wire Grid**: Interactive wire grid that warps around pointer movement.
- **Parallax Shooting Stars**: Parallax starfield with depth-based warping and chroma trails.
- **Suttle Rainbow Wisps**: Glowing script-veins that rewrite themselves in organic patterns.
- **Trippy Broken Triangles**: Interactive Voronoi diagram with pulsing bubble cells. Press P to add points.

### Props (2)
- **Afterimage Pulse**: Pulsing afterimage effect using color inversion.
- **Moire Melt**: Moire pattern effect using two overlapping images with difference blend mode.

### Modules (3)
- **Paint Splat Mix**: Interactive paint splat effect with rainbow colors. Click and drag to create paint splats.
- **Kaleido Spin Top String**: Interactive kaleidoscope drawing tool with radial symmetry. Press Q/W to adjust symmetry.
- **Spinning Rainbow Black Hole**: Interactive prism lens effect with rainbow background. Scroll to adjust refraction.

## Technical Achievements
- Successfully extracted and recreated 2 Framer export components by analyzing component names and implementing similar functionality
- All components include proper `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Standardized control UI across all components
- Added preview mode script integration to all new components

## Statistics
- **Before**: 25 normalized components
- **After**: 40 normalized components
- **Increase**: 15 components (60% growth)
- **Categories**: backgrounds: 11, cursors: 11, modules: 8, props: 4, buttons: 2, text: 3, misc: 1

## Remaining Work
- 1 button (Framer export - Purple Smile Confetti)
- 2 props (1 Framer export, 1 needs performance testing)
- 4 backgrounds (Framer exports)
- 10 modules (mostly Framer exports)

## Next Steps
- Continue extracting remaining Framer export components
- Update component inventory and catalog manifest
- Generate thumbnails for new components
