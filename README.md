# Errl Portal

A multi-app epic webapp / website / landing page to showcase our friend group mascot with trippy, experimental visuals and experiences.

## Vision
- Central landing hub that links and embeds multiple webapps/experiences.
- Emphasis on playful, “trippy” visuals to show off the mascot.
- Iterative: we’ll drop in assets and apps as they’re ready.

## Structure (initial)
- `src/` – source code and scaffold for the main site/app.
- `public/` – static assets (images, fonts, favicon, etc.).

## Next steps
- Send over the first batch of files; we’ll integrate them into `src/`/`public/` or spin up sub-apps as needed.
