# Errl Portal

A creative portal application featuring interactive visual effects, studio tools, and a component management system.

## What I'm Building

This project is an experimental web portal that combines visual design tools, interactive effects, and component management into a unified interface. It's a space for exploring creative web experiences, visual editing capabilities, and building a library of reusable components and effects.

The portal serves as both a showcase for interactive web experiences and a toolkit for creating and managing visual assets, with features like real-time effect controls, SVG editing, and a comprehensive component catalog.
