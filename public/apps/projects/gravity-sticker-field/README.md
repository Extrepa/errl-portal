# Gravity Sticker Field

A canvas-based physics toy: drag stickers; they fall, collide, and bounce. No external libraries.

## Files
- index.html, style.css, script.js
- assets/sticker.png

## How to run
- Direct file: open `index.html` in a browser (no server required)
- Via dev server: http://localhost:5173/apps/projects/gravity-sticker-field/

## Reduced motion
- When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is enabled, gravity is lowered and entity count is reduced.

## Browser support
- Modern evergreen browsers. Canvas 2D only.

## Notes
- DPR-aware canvas sizing, resize handled.
