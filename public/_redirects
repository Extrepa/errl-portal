# This file should be copied to dist/ during build

# Studio app SPA routing - redirect /studio/* to /studio.html
# But preserve actual file requests (with extensions)
/studio/*  /studio.html  200

# Portal pages routing - these are static HTML files, no redirect needed
# They're built at root level (e.g., /about/, /gallery/, /assets/)

# Fallback for any other routes to index
