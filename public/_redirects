# Portal pages routing - these are static HTML files, no redirect needed
# They're built at root level (e.g., /about/, /gallery/, /assets/)

# Fallback for SPA routes - exclude index.html and files with extensions to prevent infinite loops
# Cloudflare Pages will only apply this to paths that don't match existing files
