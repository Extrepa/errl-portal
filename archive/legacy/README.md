# Legacy Artifacts

This directory stores historical bundles and root-level exports that are no longer part of the active `main` tree.

- `Errl_Portal_Cursor_NextMove_Kit/` — archived Cursor guidance + scripts. Original structure preserved on branch `archive/legacy-kits`.
- `Errl_Portal_Cursor_NextMove_Kit.zip` — zipped form of the kit above.
- `about-legacy.html`, `index-legacy.html` — earlier standalone builds of the portal landing pages; kept for reference only.
- `standalone-pages/` — Archived standalone/legacy versions of project pages (formerly `public/`). Contains self-contained HTML pages and project demos that can run independently. These are archived and not part of the main portal build.

For the full, untouched snapshot (including these files at repo root), check out branch `archive/legacy-kits`.
