# 2025-11-12

- Normalized all portal navigation links and legacy iframe embeds via `data-portal-link`/`data-portal-frame`, preventing nested `/legacy/portal` paths.
- Refreshed the legacy Studio hub to match the new React `/studio` experience, including card grid, hero copy, and roadmap content.
- Integrated Pin Designer, Shape Madness, and Math Lab into the React Studio hub through `useLegacyAssetBridge`, enabling shared IndexedDB asset storage with Code Lab.
- Expanded Playwright coverage to verify portal link targets, Studio hub navigation, and iframe bridges; `npm test` and `npm run portal:build` successful.

Next ideas
- QA the shared asset store with larger Pin Designer exports and Code Lab imports.
- Add nightly Playwright coverage for the legacy studio page.
- Script the preview QA automation flow described in `plans/2025-11-11-preview-qa-automation.md`.
