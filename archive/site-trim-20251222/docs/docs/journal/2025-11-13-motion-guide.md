# Team Update - November 13, 2025

## 🎨 Motion Graphics Expert Guide Added

We've added **docs/team/MOTION_GRAPHICS_GUIDE.md** to the project — a comprehensive guide for animation and motion design in the Errl Portal.

### What's Inside

This expert guide covers:

- **Framer Motion** integration with React components
- **shadcn/ui** component animation patterns
- **Tailwind CSS** animations using **tw-animate-css** (Tailwind v4 compatible)
- **TypeScript** typing for motion variants and animation props
- **Performance optimization** for 60fps GPU-accelerated animations
- **Accessibility standards** with prefers-reduced-motion support

### Key Principles

1. **Performance-First**: Transform and opacity animations for GPU acceleration
2. **Accessibility**: Always respect user motion preferences with `useReducedMotion`
3. **Physics-Based Motion**: Spring animations and natural easing curves
4. **shadcn Integration**: Extends existing components with motion capabilities
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for animation props

### Important Note

⚠️ The project uses **tw-animate-css** (NOT tailwindcss-animate) for Tailwind v4 compatibility.

### When to Use This Guide

- Adding animations to Errl mascot interactions
- Creating micro-interactions for UI components
- Implementing scroll-triggered animations
- Building page transitions and navigation effects
- Extending shadcn/ui components with motion

### Next Steps

- Review the motion design principles in the guide
- Apply animation patterns to the portal landing page
- Ensure all animations respect reduced-motion preferences
- Create reusable motion variants for consistent animation vocabulary
