# Live Studio Audit — Current Issues

## Code Tab
- Layout squeezes editors/preview/console into cramped grid; console collapsed and asset drawer pushes content off screen.
- Console output hard to locate; no collapse toggles for console/assets.
- Export only offers `.errlproj`; unclear path for HTML/zip/png.
- Tooltips missing; buttons lack explanations (e.g. Format HTML/CSS/JS).

## SVG Tab
- Layer list only shows Fabric object type; no rename or quick select.
- Slider controls (optimize/unite/intersect, animation toggles) have no contextual help.
- Animation presets limited; no easing/loop options; quick actions empty.
- Uploading SVG imports geometry but path names lost; cannot edit metadata.
- Breadcrumb/navigation absent; user stuck in subpage.

## Photos Tab
- Uploads do not appear on canvas or layers list; only built-in stickers render.
- Stickers spawn at fixed top-left; no center/drag feedback; heart asset broken.
- Grid/transparent background toggles unreliable; canvas sizing inconsistent.
- Export limited to PNG/JPEG; no layered export, no project save.

## Cross-Cutting
- Missing portal header/breadcrumbs inside Live Studio; no easy return path.
- Panels lack responsive breakpoints; layout breaks below 1280px.
- Autosave/local storage silently stores state; no indicators/history.
