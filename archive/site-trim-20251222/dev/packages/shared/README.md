# Shared Package

Purpose: common fx modules, utilities, types, and shared assets consumed by portal, studio, and widgets.

- Source goes in `src/`
- Export modules via index files (`fx`, `assets`, `components`)
- Provide build outputs for reuse or tree-shaking if needed

TODO: migrate shared code from `src/` during Stage 4.
